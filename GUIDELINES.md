# General Guidelines

Following are the general guidelines we all should abide to, to keep the code consistent, reduce chances of errors and have smooth workflow.

- Use tabs for intendation, not spaces.
- Use comments, preferably multiline comments so that others can understand how the code works.
- Fork-based workflow: 
    - Fork the original repo
    - Clone the repo onto your local systems
    - Keep local repo updated via pulling
    - Whilst working on a new feature/ function/ functionality, create a branch with the name of function or functionality.
    - After committing the changes and testing thoroughly, either merge the feature branch with your master branch and then push the master branch or push the branch itself to main repo, preferably later. The changes will be merged by testing the pull request.
- Instead of making big changes into a single commit, keep the changes small and commit constantly with relavant messages.
